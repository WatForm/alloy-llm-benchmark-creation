There is a set of elements called "Person". Each "Person" has exactly one "spouse", which is a "Person", and a set called "shaken" to represent handshaking, whose members are "Person" elements.

There are exactly two distinguished "Person" elements named "Jocelyn" and "Hilary".

Neither a person nor a person’s "spouse" is in that person’s "shaken" set.

If a person is in another person’s "shaken" set, then the second person is in the first person’s "shaken" set.

For every two distinct "Person" elements, if one person’s "spouse" is the other, then the other’s "spouse" is the first.

For every two distinct "Person" elements, their "spouse" values are different.

The "spouse" of a person’s "spouse" is themselves.

No person is their own "spouse".
>>> The first "all..." block under fact Spouses is implied by the second "all..." block (with added restriction of p != p.spouse). I suggest removing lines 11 and (9 xor 13)

"Hilary"’s "spouse" is "Jocelyn".

For all two distinct "Person" elements other than "Jocelyn", the number of people in first person’s "shaken" set is different from the number of people in the second person’s "shaken" set.
