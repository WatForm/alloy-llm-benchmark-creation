# API key setup

- API keys are not stored in this repository. If you intend to run this, you are expected to have an OpenAI account and its associated API key
- The key is to be placed in `./secret/api_key.txt`
- This is to be done every time the repository is cloned, since the folder is part of `.gitignore`
- Do not place the key anywhere else, to avoid it becoming part of the commit history.
