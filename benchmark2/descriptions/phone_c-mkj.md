The Alloy model describes a system of phones with certain behaviors and relationships. In this model, each phone has three types of relationships to other phones: "requests", "connects", and "forward".

- "Requests" is a set of phones. This implies that a phone can have multiple requests from other phones.
- "Connects" is a single phone. This implies that a phone can connect with at most one other phone at a time.
- "Forward" is also a single phone. This suggests that a phone can forward a request to at most one other phone.

> single could be modelled as "one" or "lone" but in this context, it should be clear that it should be "lone" (based on how phones work)

There are two key constraints in this model:

Firstly, all connections must have corresponding requests, which can potentially be forwarded. Specifically, for any phone that does not forward any request, there is a set of phones that have requested or forwarded requests to this phone. Any phone that a phone connects with should be part of this set.

Secondly, the model prohibits conference calls. That is, for any given phone, there can be at most one phone it connects with.

This model does not describe any predicates or commands. Therefore, there are no operations or procedures specified. No expected results or scope of the model is defined either.
