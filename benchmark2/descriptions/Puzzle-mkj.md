This Alloy model is structured around three main signature classes: Event, Item, and Person. Event and Item are abstract signatures while Person is a concrete signature.

The Event signature has five distinct instances namely GraduationCeremony, TravelingAbroad, InitiationCeremony, FlowerViewing, and Hiking. 

Similarly, the Item signature also has five distinct instances which are Shoes, Handkerchief, Shirt, Slacks, and Camera.

The Person signature has five distinct instances: Tanaka, Takeuchi, Ishida, Kasai, and Aoyama. Each person holds a relation to an event and an item.

According to the constraints on this model, if two Person instances are same, their associated Event and Item are the same. If two Person instances are not the same, their associated Event and Item should not be the same.

> correct, one-to-one relations

Particularly, Tanaka is associated with a Shirt. And Takeuchi is associated with Slacks and the event of FlowerViewing.

A person associated with the event of InitiationCeremony is implied to have Shoes as their item. Ishida, however, is associated neither with Shoes nor with the InitiationCeremony event.

Kasai and Tanaka are not associated with the GraduationCeremony. 

Aoyama is not associated with both the GraduationCeremony event and the Hiking event. Furthermore, Aoyama does not have Shoes or a Camera.
