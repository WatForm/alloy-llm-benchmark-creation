The model represents a singly linked list, which comprises of two signatures (sets): List and Node.

The signature List has a single field named 'header'. The 'header' field for a List can point to a maximum of one Node. 

> maximum of one implies that it could be zero, which is "lone" in the case of an empty List. The summary is carefully worded.

The second signature represented in the model is Node. A Node has a single field named 'link'. The 'link' field for a Node can point to a maximum of one other Node.

A fact is defined in the model which enforces the acyclic nature of the singly linked list. The fact, named 'Acyclic', applies to all lists. The fact asserts that for a given list, if there is no 'header' for the list, or if there is some Node that can be reached from the 'header' of the list through following one or more 'link' fields, which does not have its 'link' pointing to another Node, the list is considered valid under this fact. In other words, the fact constrains the model such that any list either does not have a 'header' or has a 'header' from which a Node can be reached through any number of 'link' fields, which does not point to another Node. This ensures that the singly linked list can never cycle back to a previous Node and is thus, acyclic in nature.
