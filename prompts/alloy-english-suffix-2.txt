Write a natural English description of this Alloy model that captures all the information needed to reconstruct a semantically equivalent model.

Requirements:

- Use the exact names from the model (signatures, fields) - don't rename anything
- Describe what types exist, how they relate, and what constraints apply
- State constraints as simple facts, not as instructions (e.g., just say "X cannot be Y", not "create a fact that X cannot be Y")
- Don't explain HOW to implement constraints or WHY they exist - just state WHAT is constrained
- Be explicit about relationships - don't assume meaning from names (e.g., if "parent" relates to "ancestor", state that relationship explicitly)
- Include all multiplicity constraints, quantifiers, and logical conditions
- Describe predicates and commands: their names, what they check/specify, and any scope or expected results

DON'T:
- Include Alloy syntax or code
- Prescribe how to organize the model
- Explain implementation details
- Add explanations beyond stating the constraints themselves
