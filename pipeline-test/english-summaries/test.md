This model consists of three signatures: A, B, and C. Signatures A and B are generic signatures with no additional constraints, attributes, or relations associated with them. 

Signature C, however, is declared with the "one" keyword. This implies that in any instance of the model, there will be exactly one instance of signature C. 

Please note that as per the given model, there are no defined relations or constraints between these signatures. The model can be further expanded by defining attributes within the signatures or relations between them, if required.
