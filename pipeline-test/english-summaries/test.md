This model is composed of three distinct signatures, namely A, B and C.

Signature "A" itself does not hold any specific attributes or constraints in its current form. The same holds for signature "B". Both of these signatures may be understood as entities or objects with unspecified characteristics. 

Lastly, we have the signature "C". The word "one" before the signature means that in any given model or instance adhering to this specification, there must exist exactly one instance of "C". In other words, it enforces the fact that "C" is a singleton entity, meaning there would always be exactly one "C" in the system model.

Note that in their current form, these signatures are not interrelated or mapped to each other in any specific manner. Also, each of these signatures are implicit subsets of an in-built signature "univ" indicating that their instances are drawn from a universal set of atoms. This structure serves as a simple base which can be extended with fields, constraints and/or functions, according to the specific requirements of the system to be modeled. 

Thus, the model primarily establishes three distinct entities A, B and C, with the additional stipulation that exactly one instance of entity C will always exist.
