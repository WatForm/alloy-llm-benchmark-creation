This model pertains to a prison environment consisting of three primary entities: "Gang", "Inmate", and "Cell".

The "Gang" entity represents a group of inmates and is defined by a single feature: the set of its members. The members attribute represents the inmates belonging to the gang.

The "Inmate" entity represents an individual prisoner and is defined by a single feature: the cell that the inmate occupies. The room attribute is associated with a particular cell.

The "Cell" entity represents an individual prison cell. This entity has no additional attributes or properties outlined in the model.

Two predicates are also defined in this model: "safe" and "show". However, as they have not been populated, their specific functions and constraints are yet to be determined in this model.

Finally, the run command is called on the "show" predicate. This would execute whatever constraints or conditions specified under that predicate, but as it is currently not defined, there are no specifics on what it would do.
