Title: Ring Node 

The model is built around a signature named "Node". Each instance of "Node" has a relation associated with it, named "next." The "next" relation connects the instance of "Node" with another instance of Node, representing a relationship between nodes in a ring structure. 

A predicate, "isRing," is defined to characterize a main property of the model. The functionality of the "isRing" predicate has yet to be specified and is up to the designer to elaborate further.

Finally, an operation, "run isRing," is executed for exactly 4 instances of the Node, implying that the "isRing" predicate must satisfy a condition for a ring structure containing exactly 4 nodes.

NOTE: Please fill in the condition that the 'isRing' predicate must satisfy in the form of an Alloy formula. This requirement is crucial for constructing the model.
