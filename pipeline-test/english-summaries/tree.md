This alloy model is named 'tree' and is a part of the supplementary appendixA.

The model is centered around one key predicate called 'isTree'. This arbiter checks whether a provided relation 'r' that maps from a set in the universe to another in the universe meets the characteristics of a tree. The specifics of what conditions 'r' must satisfy to be considered a tree have not been defined in this model and should be filled in by the user.

Finally, there is a command to run the predicate 'isTree' for a model consisting of four elements. The output of running this command should validate whether the relation 'r' satisfying the conditions defined in 'isTree' can be created for a universe of four elements. 

Please note, as this is just a skeleton, the model needs to be filled out with specifics to formulate the detailed constraints for the 'isTree' predicate.
